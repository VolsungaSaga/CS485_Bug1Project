<H2><A NAME="sec_compiling"></A>Part I. Simulation [50 pts]</H2>

<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Implement a potential field
	planner for a <EM><B>rigid robot translating and rotating in
	the plane</B></EM> (50pts)
	</P>

        <LI> <P>Environment consists of a robot, a goal region
         represented as a circle, and several obstacles also
         represented as circles.  The graphical interface supports the
         dynamic addition and displacement of obstacles and goal. A
         new obstacle can be added at any time by pressing down the
         left-button of the mouse. Each obstacle and the goal can be
         moved around by clicking inside them and holding the
         left-button down while moving the mouse. To run the planner,
         user needs to press the key 'p' on the keyboard. Pressing 'p'
         again toggles between running and stopping the planner. User
         can change the radius of each obstacle and the goal by first
         pressing the key 'r' and then clicking inside an
         obstacle/goal, holding the left-button down while moving the
         mouse. Pressing 'r' again toggles between editing radius or
         moving the obstacles and the goal. </P> </LI>

        <LI> <P>The simulator provides access to the goal center, goal
        radius, number of obstacles, current robot configuration
        (robot x, robot y, robot theta), and vertices of the polygon
        representing the robot. Simulator also computes the closest
        point on the i-th obstacle for any given point (x, y), see
        function <B>ClosestPointOnObstacle</B></P></LI>

        <LI> <P>When computing the potential, it is recommended that
        you use each vertex of the polygon robot as a control
        point.</P></LI>

        <LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For each control point (xj,
	yj), you should then: </P>

		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">compute the
		workspace gradient (wsg<SUB>i</SUB>) to each obstacle
		[In my implementation, wsg<SUB>i</SUB> is zero if the
		distance from (xj, yj) to the closest point on the
		i-th obstacle is larger than a small constant. I then
		scale the gradient in order to ensure that the robot
		gets pushed away when coming close to the
		obstacles. You may need to play around in order to
		figure out by how much to scale the gradient in order
		to get the desired behavior.]</P></LI>

		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">use the Jacobian
		matrix to transform wsg<SUB>i</SUB> into a
		configuration space gradient csg<SUB>i</SUB>, which is
		then added to the overall configuration space gradient
		csg </P></LI>

		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">compute the
		workspace gradient to the goal, scale it
		appropriately, transform it into a configuration space
		gradient via the Jacobian, and add it to the overall
		configuration space gradient</P></LI>
	</UL>
	
        <LI><P>When the overall configuration space gradient has been
	computed, scale it so that you make a small move in x and y
	and a small move in theta. Recall that the robot should always
	move in direction opposite to the gradient.</P></LI>

        <LI><P> If you implement a strategy for the robot to escape
        local minima, you will be awarded 10 extra credit
        points.</P></LI>

        <LI> <P>If using <B>C++</B> support code, you should implement
        the function <B>ConfigurationMove</B> in the
        class <B>RigidBodyPlanner.</B>  This function should
        return <B>RigidBodyMove</B>, which represents a small move
        (dx, dy, dtheta) by the robot.</P></LI>

<H2><A NAME="sec_compiling3"></A>Suggested Milestones and Division of Labor</H2>
<UL>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> You have 3.5 weeks for this
project, but time flies. So, keeping track of milestones and dividing
labor increases your chances of completing this assignment in time. I
suggest three milestones.</P>

<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> If working in a 4-member team, you
should spend no more than 1.5 weeks, to coding the potential field
planner in the simulation environment. I suggest you all participate
in it to get hands-on understanding of the behavior of planner. You
can take short breaks from coding and use those breaks to get the hang
of the new sonar sensors and how to use them in the pioneer to
accomplish the servoing behavior. This is milestone 1.</P>

<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> Once done with this milestone, and
you get the structure of the code, it will be easier to proceed with
implementing the repulsion behavior. This should be milestone 2. This
should not take more than half a week.</P>

<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> The last 1.5 weeks should then be
    devoted to finishing up the implementation and possibly adding on
    to the simulation to get the extra credit points.</P>
