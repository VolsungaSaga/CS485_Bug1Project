First notes:

Things we have:
-Simulator (has a lot of useful methods for us); asks us where our goal is,
    where our robot is, where are we going, have we reached our state, etc.
-Motion Planner looks at our configuration space; however, it also asks us to 
    find a path from our initial point to where we want to go
-Three Rules for ExtendTree:
    +If we sampling the vertices, we need to make sure they aren't in any objects
    +If we're sampling the edges, we need to make sure they aren't also in any objects
