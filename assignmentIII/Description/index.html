<H1>Project 3: Sampling-Based Motion Planning</H1>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Due Date: Nov-16-2016</B> <B>@ 11:59PM</B> 
</P>
<P>In this project, you will implement several sampling-based motion
planners for a simple point robot operating in a 2D workspace. You
will implement the following functions that will gradually walk you
towards implementing EST, RRT, and your tree-based planner of choice.
Notice that for the purpose of this assignment, the word state is
used interchangeably for configuration. Since you are dealing with a
point robot in a 2D workspace, the state/configuration is only (x,
y).</P>

<P>Environment consists of a robot, a goal, and obstacles (all
represented as circles). Graphical interface supports the dynamic
addition and displacement of obstacles and goal. A new obstacle can
be added at any time by pressing down the left-button of the mouse.
Each obstacle and the goal can be moved around by clicking inside
them and holding the left-button down while moving the mouse. User
can change the radius of each obstacle and the goal by first pressing
the key 'r' and then clicking inside an obstacle/goal, holding the
left-button down while moving the mouse. Pressing 'r' again toggles
between editing radius or moving the obstacles and the goal. 
</P>
<P><B>First edit the scene and then run the planner. Do not make
changes to the scene once the planner has started. Also do not change
the initial position of the robot via the graphical interface, but
use instead the input text file</B>.
